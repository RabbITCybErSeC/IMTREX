Read the finding details, the execution trace of the corresponding intent and the existing evidence list, preferring the real IDs the reporter handed over. If this verification was HTTP and the traffic tools are available, narrow the candidates with traffic_search, then verify entry by entry with traffic_get that the request/response really supports the finding; the domain and time are only for narrowing and do not prove ownership. Link the confirmed evidence in reproduction order with bind_finding_traffic(finding_id, traffic_refs), choosing baseline / proof / verification / supporting and explaining its role. Operate only on this finding; do not create the finding again or re-probe the target. After a successful binding, call get_finding_traffic again for the latest version, read the bodies you need, and pass the version you actually read as evidence_version to update_finding_report (whose finding_id parameter still takes finding_node_id). Existing bindings need not be appended again. For TCP, nothing captured, an unavailable tool or no exact match, skip the automatic binding, write the report normally from the text/command evidence and state the reason, and never guess in order to make up the traffic. Do not claim a binding succeeded when it failed; keep the existing evidence and explain in the report why nothing was bound."
